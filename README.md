# ðŸ¤– Agent ADK Lab Collection

A hands-on playground of **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** examples â€” from the simplest agent to advanced multi-agent orchestration.  
This repo is structured as a progressive learning path: start with a **basic agent**, then build toward **stateful, parallel, and loop-driven agent systems**.

| #  | Example                    | Description |
|----|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | **basic_agent**            | Your very first agent: minimal setup and execution. |
| 2  | **tool_agent**             | Extend your agent with external tool integration. |
| 3  | **litellm_agent**          | Power your agent with LiteLLM as the model provider. |
| 4  | **structured_outputs**     | Ensure your agents produce reliable, typed outputs. |
| 5  | **sessions_and_memory**    | Add memory across agent interactions. |
| 6  | **persistent_storage**     | Store and retrieve agent state beyond a single session. |
| 8  | **stateful_multi_agent**   | Coordinate stateful collaboration between multiple agents. |
| 9  | **callbacks**              | Add hooks for monitoring and debugging agent actions. |
| 10 | **sequential_agent**       | Chain tasks in sequence across one or more agents. |
| 11 | **parallel_agent**         | Run multiple agents concurrently for faster workflows. |
| 12 | **loop_agent**             | Build feedback loops for iterative reasoning and execution. |
